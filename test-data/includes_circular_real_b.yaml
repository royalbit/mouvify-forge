# Real circular dependency test - File B depends back on A (via value_a)

# Note: This creates a circular dependency if A includes B and B's formula
# references A's variable. However, our current implementation doesn't support
# B including A back (would be infinite recursion at parse time).
# Instead, this tests a formula in B that would reference A's variable if it could.

value_b:
  value: null
  formula: "=value_a + 1"
