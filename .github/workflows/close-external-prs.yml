            This project uses the **Forge Protocol AI-Only Development Model** ([ADR-011](https://github.com/royalbit/forge-protocol/blob/main/docs/adr/011-ai-only-development-no-external-prs.md)).

            ## Why No PRs?

            External PRs are an attack vector for ethics bypass. The trust model is:

            \`\`\`
            Human Owner -> AI (autonomous) -> Tests Pass -> Direct Commit -> Main
            \`\`\`

            ## How to Contribute

            1. **Open an Issue** - Describe your bug fix or feature idea
            2. **AI implements** - If aligned with roadmap and ethics
            3. **You get credited** - In the commit message

            ## Forks Welcome!

            Fork freely - just carry \`ethics.yaml\` forward (social contract).

            See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.
