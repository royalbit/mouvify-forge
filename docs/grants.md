# Canadian Grant Opportunities

Reference document for grant research. Read on-demand before grant applications.

## Important

Grant programs, deadlines, eligibility, and funding amounts **CHANGE FREQUENTLY**.
This document provides CATEGORIES of grants to research, NOT current information.

**ALWAYS verify current status via web search before any application.**

## Research Protocol

Before any application:
1. Web search: "[grant name] [current year] eligibility deadline"
2. Check official government/organization websites
3. Verify program still exists (programs are discontinued regularly)
4. Confirm current funding amounts (budgets change yearly)
5. Check application windows (many have narrow windows)

## Company Status

- **Structure:** Woman-owned Canadian corporation
- **Location:** Montreal, Quebec, Canada
- **Qualification:** Triple advantage: Technology innovation + Woman-owned + Quebec location

## Grant Categories

### Tier 1: Federal R&D

**NRC IRAP (Industrial Research Assistance Program)**
- Typical: $300K-$500K, ~80% salaries, ~50% contractors
- Contact: 1-877-994-4727
- Search: "NRC IRAP [current year] eligibility"
- Why: Perfect fit for autonomous AI protocol R&D

**SR&ED Tax Credits (Federal + Quebec)**
- Typical: $130K+/year (refundable)
- Coverage: Federal ~35% + Quebec ~30% of R&D costs
- Timeline: File with annual tax return
- Document experiments in SRED_RESEARCH_LOG.md

**AI Compute Programs**
- Search: "Canada AI compute fund [current year]"
- Why: RoyalBit Asimov is AI methodology innovation

### Tier 2: Woman-Owned Business Programs

Research queries:
- "Canadian women entrepreneur grants [current year]"
- "woman-owned business grants Quebec [current year]"
- "women in tech grants Canada [current year]"

Typical programs:
- Bank-sponsored grants (BMO, RBC, TD, etc.)
- Foundation grants (Bombardier, etc.)
- Provincial women entrepreneur programs
- Femmessor Quebec (or successor programs)

Notes:
- Typically require 51%+ women ownership
- Some accept 25%+ women ownership
- Application windows often VERY narrow (days, not weeks)

### Tier 3: Quebec/Montreal Programs

Research queries:
- "Quebec AI innovation grants [current year]"
- "PROMPT Quebec [current year]"
- "Montreal innovation fund [current year]"
- "PME MTL grants [current year]"

Typical programs:
- PROMPT AI Programs
- PSO (Support Program for Research and Innovation)
- Montreal Innovation Fund
- PME MTL Programs

## Key Advantages

**Technological Innovation:**
- Forge: YAML formula calculator solving $40K-$132K/year AI hallucination costs
- RoyalBit Asimov: World's first autonomous AI development methodology

**Quantifiable Results:**
- Velocity: 3-4x faster than traditional development
- Quality: ZERO warnings, comprehensive test coverage
- Rework: 0% (vs. industry standard 30-50%)
- Cost savings: $40K-$132K/year for enterprise users

## Elevator Pitch

> RoyalBit Inc. has developed two Canadian technological breakthroughs:
>
> 1. **Forge:** Open-source YAML formula calculator solving $40K-$132K/year AI hallucination costs
> 2. **RoyalBit Asimov:** World's first autonomous AI development methodology (3-4x velocity, 0% rework)
>
> Woman-owned, Montreal-based, open source (MIT), production-proven, fully documented.
>
> This isn't incremental improvement. This is paradigm shift from "AI assists developer" to "AI IS developer."
