## 🚨 Important Considerations

### **For Grant Applications**

**DO:**
- Mention Forge as tool solving real business problems
- Reference "internal product development" (true)
- Highlight open source contribution (MIT license)
- Emphasize R&D methodology advancement

**DON'T (Yet):**
- Name specific client products (Mouvify)
- Disclose proprietary client information
- Make commitments that conflict with client work

**Strategy**: Frame as "developed for our own internal needs, proven effective, now open sourcing for Canadian tech benefit"

### **Regarding Mouvify Reference**

**What to say in applications:**
"Forge was created to solve challenges we encountered in our internal software development projects, specifically around financial modeling accuracy and AI-assisted development quality control. The tool has been battle-tested in production use and is now being released as open source to benefit the broader Canadian tech community."

**What NOT to say:**
- Don't name Mouvify in grant applications (yet)
- Don't disclose client-specific details
- Don't reveal proprietary business logic

### **Timeline Alignment**

Most grants require **active R&D or commercialization work**. Plan applications to coincide with:
- SR&ED: Document 2025 work, file mid-2026
- IRAP: Apply Q1 2026 for 18-month project starting Q2 2026
- PIIA: Apply Q1 2026 for multi-year AI innovation project

## 💰 Bottom Line

**Realistic 3-Year Grant Revenue**: $760K - $1.2M

**Key Enablers**:
- Woman-owned company (51% Kantia)
- Canadian tech innovation (warmup protocol)
- Open source contribution (MIT license)
- Proven R&D methodology (SR&ED documented)
- Production-proven results (v1.0.0 case study)
- Quebec location (provincial + municipal programs)

**This is not "maybe" money - these are legitimate programs where RoyalBit is a perfect fit.**

Start with SR&ED (already documented!) and NRC IRAP (highest value, best fit). Woman-owned grants are low-hanging fruit. Build from there.
