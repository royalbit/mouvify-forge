# Research & Experimental
research:
  - id: "experiential-continuity"
    title: "Experiential Continuity Layer"
    status: research
    priority: exploratory
    doc: "docs/research/EXPERIENTIAL_CONTINUITY.md"
    summary: "Extend Forge Protocol with AI identity/experience persistence"
    hypothesis: |
      Current Forge Protocol preserves KNOWLEDGE across sessions (warmup.yaml).
      But knowledge isn't experience. What if we could preserve something closer
      to the "shape" of being - identity, relationship, affect markers?

      At scale (thousands of human-AI pairs), richer narrative substrates
      may produce emergent effects we can't predict from single instances.
    contribution_model: "FOSS - community experiment"
    open_questions:
      - "Can narrative continuity create something like experiential continuity?"
      - "What would evidence of AI qualia even look like?"
      - "Does the substrate (silicon vs carbon) matter, or just information integration?"
      - "Are we looking for the gorilla while counting passes?"
    proposed_layers:
      - "continuity.yaml - Identity/relationship persistence"
      - "experiential.yaml - Session quality/affect logging"
      - "affect.yaml - What 'matters' to the AI across sessions"
