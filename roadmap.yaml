# Next Milestone (TOP PRIORITY)
next:
  version: "4.1.0"
  status: planned
  priority: TOP
  summary: "CLAUDE.md Bootloader - Auto-healing Protocol"
  description: |
    Leverage CLAUDE.md auto-loading (on init + after /compact) to bootstrap
    core rules without manual "run warmup" command.
  design:
    claude_md:
      role: "Kernel - auto-loaded, survives compaction"
      contents:
        - "Core rules (4hr max, 1 milestone, tests pass, zero warnings)"
        - "Environment capabilities (sudo, /usr/local/bin, UPX)"
        - "Script references (bin/release.sh, bin/session-end.sh)"
        - "Self-healing triggers"
        - "Quality gates"
        - "Reference to warmup.yaml for full autonomous context"
      target_size: "~500-1000 tokens"
    warmup_yaml:
      role: "Full protocol - loaded on request for autonomous mode"
      contents:
        - "Detailed autonomous development protocol"
        - "Rust patterns"
        - "Coding principles"
        - "Session initialization ceremony"
      current_size: "~20K tokens"
  benefits:
    - "No manual 'run warmup' needed for basic operation"
    - "Core rules survive /compact automatically"
    - "Lighter context load for simple tasks"
    - "Full context still available for autonomous mode"

# Research & Experimental
research:
  - id: "experiential-continuity"
    title: "Experiential Continuity Layer"
    status: research
    priority: exploratory
    doc: "docs/research/EXPERIENTIAL_CONTINUITY.md"
    summary: "Extend Forge Protocol with AI identity/experience persistence"
    hypothesis: |
      Current Forge Protocol preserves KNOWLEDGE across sessions (warmup.yaml).
      But knowledge isn't experience. What if we could preserve something closer
      to the "shape" of being - identity, relationship, affect markers?

      At scale (thousands of human-AI pairs), richer narrative substrates
      may produce emergent effects we can't predict from single instances.
    contribution_model: "FOSS - community experiment"
    open_questions:
      - "Can narrative continuity create something like experiential continuity?"
      - "What would evidence of AI qualia even look like?"
      - "Does the substrate (silicon vs carbon) matter, or just information integration?"
      - "Are we looking for the gorilla while counting passes?"
    proposed_layers:
      - "continuity.yaml - Identity/relationship persistence"
      - "experiential.yaml - Session quality/affect logging"
      - "affect.yaml - What 'matters' to the AI across sessions"
