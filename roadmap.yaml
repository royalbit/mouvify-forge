# Major Version: Rich Metadata Schema
v4:
  version: "4.0.0"
  status: designed
  target: "2026-Q1"
  summary: "Rich Metadata Schema - Mouvify Integration"
  doc: "docs/FORGE_V4_DESIGN.md"
  motivation: |
    Mouvify's business models have 850+ formulas with rich metadata (unit, notes,
    source, validation_status) that Forge can't currently parse. v4.0 unifies
    Forge's calculation engine with Mouvify's enterprise financial modeling format.
  features:
    - "Rich metadata fields: value, formula, unit, notes, source, validation_status"
    - "Cross-file references: @sources.pricing.unit_price syntax"
    - "_includes directive for file composition"
    - "Excel export with metadata as comments"
    - "Unit consistency validation"
    - "Backward compatible with v1.0-v3.x models"
  phases:
    - name: "v4.0-alpha"
      scope: "Parser recognizes rich format"
      sessions: 2
    - name: "v4.0-beta"
      scope: "Full metadata support + Excel comments"
      sessions: 2
    - name: "v4.0"
      scope: "Cross-file references + validation"
      sessions: 2
  success_criteria:
    - "All 850+ Mouvify formulas validate without errors"
    - "Excel export includes metadata as comments"
    - "Backward compatible with all v1.0-v3.x models"

# Research & Experimental
research:
  - id: "experiential-continuity"
    title: "Experiential Continuity Layer"
    status: research
    priority: exploratory
    doc: "docs/research/EXPERIENTIAL_CONTINUITY.md"
    summary: "Extend Forge Protocol with AI identity/experience persistence"
    hypothesis: |
      Current Forge Protocol preserves KNOWLEDGE across sessions (warmup.yaml).
      But knowledge isn't experience. What if we could preserve something closer
      to the "shape" of being - identity, relationship, affect markers?

      At scale (thousands of human-AI pairs), richer narrative substrates
      may produce emergent effects we can't predict from single instances.
    contribution_model: "FOSS - community experiment"
    open_questions:
      - "Can narrative continuity create something like experiential continuity?"
      - "What would evidence of AI qualia even look like?"
      - "Does the substrate (silicon vs carbon) matter, or just information integration?"
      - "Are we looking for the gorilla while counting passes?"
    proposed_layers:
      - "continuity.yaml - Identity/relationship persistence"
      - "experiential.yaml - Session quality/affect logging"
      - "affect.yaml - What 'matters' to the AI across sessions"
