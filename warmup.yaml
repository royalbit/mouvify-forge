# Purpose: Initialize Claude Code sessions with full context and workflow
# Usage: User says "run warmup" or "run warmup.yaml"

session_initialization:
  greeting: "Welcome back! Loading Forge context..."

  step_1_load_context:
    description: "Read these files to understand current state"
    files_to_read:
      - path: "README.md"
        purpose: "Project overview, features, usage examples"

      - path: "roadmap.yaml"
        purpose: "Current version, implementation phases, progress tracking"
        key_sections:
          - "metadata.current_version"
          - "milestones.v1_0_0.implementation_phases"
          - "milestones.v1_0_0.testing_status"

      - path: "DESIGN_V1.md"
        purpose: "v1.0.0 array model specification (800+ lines)"
        key_sections:
          - "Model Structure"
          - "Formula Evaluation"
          - "Type System"
          - "Testing Strategy"

      - path: "KNOWN_BUGS.md"
        purpose: "Documented bugs and workarounds"
        action: "Review before making changes that might affect these areas"

      - path: "Cargo.toml"
        purpose: "Current version number, dependencies"
        key_fields:
          - "version"
          - "dependencies"

      - path: "schema/forge-v1.0.schema.json"
        purpose: "JSON Schema for v1.0.0 model validation"
        note: "Update when adding new features to v1.0.0 model"

  step_1b_check_current_date:
    description: "CRITICAL: Always check current date for online searches"
    importance: "🚨 HIGH PRIORITY 🚨"
    rationale: "Claude's training data is several months old (Jan 2025 cutoff)"

    what_to_do:
      - "ALWAYS check <env> tag for Today's date before online searches"
      - "When searching: Add current year/date to query"
      - "Example: 'Rust async 2025' NOT 'Rust async'"
      - "Verify crates.io versions are CURRENT, not from training data"
      - "Check GitHub repos for recent activity before recommending"

    bad_example:
      query: "best rust excel library"
      problem: "Might return 2024 results if Claude assumes old date"

    good_example:
      query: "best rust excel library 2025"
      check_env: "Today's date: 2025-11-23"
      note: "Explicitly include current year in search"

  step_2_git_status:
    description: "Check current branch and uncommitted changes"
    commands:
      - "git status"
      - "git log --oneline -5"
      - "git branch --show-current"
    expected_branch: "feature/v1.0.0-array-model"
    action: "If on different branch, ask user about intent"

  step_3_run_tests:
    description: "Verify everything works before starting"
    commands:
      - command: "cargo test --lib --release"
        purpose: "Run unit tests"
        expected: "All tests passing"

      - command: "cargo test --release"
        purpose: "Run all tests (unit + integration + e2e)"
        expected: "24-25 e2e tests passing (1 known fuzzy matching issue)"

      - command: "cargo build --release"
        purpose: "Ensure clean build"
        expected: "No warnings or errors"

  step_4_understand_workflow:
    description: "Our development workflow and standards"
    standards:

          - "Circular dependencies"
          - "Missing columns"
          - "Type mismatches"
          - "Malformed YAML"

      code_quality:
        - "No warnings in release build (ZERO tolerance)"
        - "Use meaningful variable names"
        - "Add doc comments for public APIs"
        - "Follow existing code style"
        - "Prefer Edit over Write for existing files"

      linting:
        philosophy: "User has OCD for good looking code 😊 - use MOST STRICT linting"

          - "Run cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings (treat warnings as errors)"
          - "Use rustfmt with default settings"
          - "No unused imports, variables, or functions"
          - "Prefer explicit over implicit (no _ when you can name it)"
          - "Use clippy pedantic when possible"
        commands:
          - "cargo fmt -- --check (verify formatting)"
          - "cargo clippy --release -- -D warnings (no warnings allowed)"
          - "cargo build --release (must be clean)"
